## Cle Final Project Team TV Backlog Organizer

Figuring out what to watch next when there are so many shows and movies you want to watch/your friends think you should watch! 
There are a lot of shows out there and with so much to choose from, it's often hard to choose what to watch in our isolation...

### Minimum Viable Product
1. A list of shows that each user has watched, is watching, and wants to watch
2. Can add/edit/delete shows/movies to your own lists
3. Ability to leave ratings and comments on individual shows/movies on your own lists, and on other people's lists to help you and your friends decide what to watch

### Future Features
1. Have separate views/main elements for each show that could include embedded Youtube video of the preview of that show, or other pertinent info
2. A true auth system that allows users to create a username with which they'd interact with the web app
3. An IM service where users could message each other while logged in
4. Interaction with other APIs like Google that could assist in bringing in shows that are out there on streaming platforms to help suggest new shows based on what you've watched
